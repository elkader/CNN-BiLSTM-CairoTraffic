# CNN-BiLSTM-CairoTraffic
CNN-Bidirectional LSTM network to forecast long term traffic flow in Cairo.

Overview

This repository contains the code used to apply a hybrid model that combines a bidirectional LSTM block and a convolutional block to estimate long-term traffic flow in four Cairo stations. A convolutional neural network, a maxpooling layer, and a flatten layer make up the first block. The second one is made up of a dense layer, a dropout layer, and a bidirectional LSTM network. All of the datasets including the predictor and target variables are also included in this repository. The last part of this file is a summary of the predictor variables.

In Results, you can also view the CNN-BiLSTM model's and six baseline models' outcomes over four Cairo stations.
